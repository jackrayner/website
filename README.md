## Hello! ðŸ¤

You appear to have the repository for my personal website! I use this as a place for me to put posts on my pet-projects and interesting bits of information that I come across on my travels.

This site is currently using the Jekyll [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) mostly because I'm lazy and I like simplistic design.

Some notes for __*Future Jackâ„¢*__ on how to work with this locally on his MacBook:

### Pre-requisites
```
$ brew install ruby
$ export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
```

### Running the Jekyll server

```
$ cd website/
$ make serve
```

## TODOs/FIXMEs

* Probably understand how Jekyll works a bit better...
* Rakefile vs Makefile?
* Backfill `_posts` with content from my brain.
